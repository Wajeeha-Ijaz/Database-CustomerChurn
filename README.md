## This project is about How we can use python to perform EDA , transform onw file into dfferent files according to our ERD and then load data files in our database at MySQL. 
## Steps :
### Data Exploration and Cleaning:
- Here is my [dataset](https://github.com/Wajeeha-Ijaz/Database-CustomerChurn/blob/main/WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv)
- Loaded the dataset in jupyter notebook and performed EDA to explore and see how is our dataset actually looks and is there any dirty data or null values, using pandas library.
- Here is the python code for [EDA](https://github.com/Wajeeha-Ijaz/Database-CustomerChurn/blob/main/EDA_001.ipynb)
### Data Modeling:
- In step 2, we need to do data modeling, so that we can create a database on it. 
- Here is my [data mode](https://github.com/Wajeeha-Ijaz/Database-CustomerChurn/blob/main/My%20model.mwb).
### ETL Process:
- As we have already extracted and transformed the data n step 1 now its time to load our data in our database that we have created using MYSQL.
- I have used Python code to perform ETL process.
- Here is my [python code](https://github.com/Wajeeha-Ijaz/Database-CustomerChurn/blob/main/Assignment_001_ETL.ipynb) for ETL process.
- Imported Data files to MYSQL schema using forward engineering in MySQL. 
- Here is my [database](https://github.com/Wajeeha-Ijaz/Database-CustomerChurn/blob/main/database.sql).
- [Data Analysis](https://github.com/Wajeeha-Ijaz/Database-CustomerChurn/blob/main/Script.sql) with SQL
